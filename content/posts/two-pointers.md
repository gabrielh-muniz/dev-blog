The two pointers technique is a powerful strategy commonly used in algorithmic problem-solving, particularly in array and linked lists. This post delves into the fundamentals of the technique, explaining how it works, when to apply it and its advantages. We'll explore real-world examples and step-by-step solutions to problems like removing duplicates in-place. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or looking to enhance your algorithm toolkit, this guide will provide you with practical insights and visual illustrations to help you master the two pointers technique.

# Two Pointers

As you already read, two pointers is an effective technique for solving programming problems. Usually, this approach is used for optimize arrays or linked list problems that used nested loops as a solution. One of the motivations to use this technique is to improve **time** and **space** complexity.

The concept of this method involves using two pointers (or indices) that points to a different element and moves independently through the data structure, checking for a certain condition. These pointers can either move twoards each other or in the same direction, depending on the problem at hand. For instance, in problems involving sorted arrays, two pointers can start at opposite ends and work towards the center, checking conditions like finding pairs that sum to a target value. Another common use case is in sliding window problems, where one pointer marks the beginning of a potential solution, while the other expands or contracts the window to find the optimal result.

## How it works?

The idea is to manipulate two pointers (or indices) that satisfy a certain condition. First, we initialize two pointers (left and right). The starting position of each pointer depends on the problem. Then, at each step, the elements or indices that the pointers refer to are checked or modified. After that, you move (increment or decrement) these pointers based on the condition checked previously. Three possible movements can be made: towards each other, away from each other, or in the same direction. Finally, left and right are checked by the loop condition to terminate the algorithm.
